So you've received your Raspberry Pi kit.  How do you get started?

The Raspberry Pi in this kit is a small but powerful computer, and it’s great for experimenting with.  You can use it as a desktop running office applications, as a media server or games console, to experiment with electronics and control, or to learn how to write code.  There is loads of material on the internet to help you explore its capabilities, and we’ve provided a set of tutorials to help you.

## What’s in the box?

In the box, you should find the following:
 
### The raspberry pi computer

### A case to put it in

### A memory card
This comes with an adapter, which you don’t need for the pi but you can use to plug it into a laptop.

### A power supply

### A HDMI cable for connecting to a television or monitor

The kit doesn’t contain a keyboard or mouse, so you’ll need to get these.  Any standard USB mouse and keyboard should work, and they are very cheap to buy.  You’ll also need a monitor or a TV with a spare HDMI input (most modern TVs have this).

## Getting set up

1. Insert the memory card into the holder on the bottom of the raspberry pi (on the right in the picture).  It will only go in one way round.

2. Plug in your keyboard and mouse to the USB ports.

3. Connect the small end of the HDMI cable to the socket marked ‘HDMI0’, and the large end to an empty HDMI socket on your TV or monitor.  NB The lead may have little protective plastic caps on each end, which you can remove.

3. Connect the power supply cable to the pi.  It’s important to know that the pi doesn’t have an on/off switch.  It comes on as soon as the power does, but to switch it off safely you should never just unplug it.  Always shut it down via the ‘logout’ option on the main menu before removing the power.

That’s all there is to it.  When you switch it on, lights will flash on the pi, and your screen should soon start showing something like this:

If it doesn’t, you might need to manually set your TV to use the right HDMI input.  

After a few seconds more, the full desktop should start up, which will look like this:

Up in the top left of the display, you’ll find the main menu and the web browser.  In the top right, you can click on the icon to connect to your wifi.

If you’ve used a Linux computer before, this might be quite familiar.  If you’re more used to Windows or Mac systems, it’s still the same basic idea.  We’ve put some folders on the desktop which contain some tutorials to get you started.  The one called “Worksheets - start here” is a good place to go first.  It contains a series of short exercises to whet your appetite.
